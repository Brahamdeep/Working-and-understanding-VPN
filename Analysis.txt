📄 VPN Report – Task 8: Working and Understanding VPN


✅ 1. VPN Setup Steps
Step 1: Choose a VPN Service
I selected ProtonVPN, a trustworthy and secure free VPN provider known for strong encryption, unlimited bandwidth, and a no-logs policy.


Step 2: Sign Up
    Visited https://protonvpn.com

    Signed up using an email ID and created a password

    Verified email to activate the account


Step 3: Download and Install
    Downloaded the ProtonVPN app for Windows from the official site

    Installed the app using the setup wizard

    Launched the application successfully


Step 4: Log In
    Logged into the ProtonVPN desktop client using registered credentials

    Step 5: Connect to a Server
    Clicked “Quick Connect” to connect to the fastest available free server

    Connected to a Netherlands-based server

    App displayed a green “Connected” status with server and new IP address


Step 6: Verify IP Address
    Before VPN: IP was linked to my real location (India)

    After VPN: IP changed to a Netherlands-based IP (masked here for privacy)

    Verified using https://whatismyipaddress.com


Step 7: Browse to Test Encryption
    Browsed several websites including DuckDuckGo, YouTube, and ProtonMail

    Verified that traffic was encrypted (HTTPS) and routed through the VPN


Step 8: Disconnect and Compare
    Disconnected the VPN

    IP reverted to the original ISP-assigned address

    Browsing speed slightly improved without the VPN, as expected


🔐  VPN Encryption and Privacy Features
    🔒 Encryption Protocols
        OpenVPN and WireGuard supported — both secure, open-source, and trusted by industry professionals

        ProtonVPN uses AES-256 encryption, considered military-grade

        Includes Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): generates unique keys for each session


🛡️ Privacy Features
    No-Logs Policy: ProtonVPN does not track browsing or IP data

    Kill Switch: Cuts internet if VPN drops, preventing data leaks

    DNS Leak Protection: Ensures DNS requests are also encrypted and anonymized

    IPv6 Leak Blocking: Stops IPv6 traffic from bypassing the VPN tunnel

    Secure Core (ProtonVPN feature): Routes traffic through multiple hardened servers for better anonymity

    Tor Over VPN: Option to route traffic through Tor network for extra privacy


📌  Summary – VPN Benefits and Limitations
    ✅ Benefits
    Hides your IP and location for private, anonymous browsing

    Encrypts data on public Wi-Fi, protecting credentials and personal info

    Bypasses geo-restrictions and internet censorship

    Useful for cybersecurity practices like testing or secure research

    Prevents ISP tracking and targeted ads


⚠️ Limitations
    Slightly reduces internet speed due to encryption and routing overhead

    Doesn’t block phishing or malware — not a replacement for antivirus

    Free VPNs may have limited features, servers, or slower speeds

    Some websites block VPN traffic

    Not all VPNs are trustworthy — some log and sell data


🧠 Conclusion
    VPNs are essential tools for ensuring privacy and security online. Through this task, I learned how to install, configure, and use a VPN client to protect my data and mask my identity online. While VPNs offer strong encryption and privacy, they must be used alongside other cybersecurity practices for full protection.
